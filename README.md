# hello-world

Hello whomever is reading this!

My name is Victor, or Vic if you want to be friends, and am pursuing a career in the field of computer science.
What does that mean?  Well, it means I like technology and programming and want to get better in both.
Currently, I am working on my bachelor's degree and thought it is about time I try and create a presence on my GitHub.
