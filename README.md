#### First Program

My first program was a C# console application in 2017 that is found below. This was created in my Introduction to Programming course at Davenport University.

```csharp
// A simple hello world program in C#
using System;

public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

I have enjoyed recreating hello world programs in different languages and frameworks for myself and as a demonstration of languages I have familiarity with. Samples of these programs can be found [here](./samples/)
