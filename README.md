# Hello World

Hello, GitHub community!! This is and was my first repository ever created from my collegiate days. It serves two purposes: (1) to provide an "about me" introduction to myself as a software engineer and (2) intermittently update and showcase some various hello world programs in different languages I have used.

## About Me

My name is Victor Frye. For brevity, recruiters and technical scouts can visit me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorfrye) to find an active, up-to-date profile.

## Program

My first program was a C# console application in 2017 that is found below. This was created in my Introduction to Programming course at Davenport University.

```csharp
// A simple hello world program in C#
using System;

public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

I have enjoyed revisiting the hello world program in different languages and frameworks. Samples of these programs can be found [here](./samples/)
