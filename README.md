# Hello World

## About
Hello whomever is reading this!

My name is Victor and I am pursuing a career in the field of computer science.  What does that mean?  Well, it means I like technology and programming and want to get better in both.  Currently, I am working on my bachelor's degree and thought it is about time I try and establish my presence on GitHub.

For the purpose of programming, you can find a hello world program from each languages I am familiar with in this repository.
