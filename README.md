# Hello World
Hello, GitHub community!! This is and was my first repository ever created from my collegiate days. It serves two purposes: (1) to provide an "about me" introduction to myself as a software engineer and (2) intermittently update and showcase a basic hello world program that has evolved since the first lines of code I wrote.

## About Me
My name is Victor Frye. For brevity, recruiters and technical scouts can find a resume included in this repository or go to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/victorfrye) to find an active, up-to-date profile.

## Program
My first program was a C# console application in 2017 that is found below. This was created in my Introduction to Programming course at Davenport University.
```
// A simple hello world program in C#

using System;

public class HelloWorld
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Hello, world!");
	}
}
```

I have enjoyed revisiting this simple program as a way to explore minimalistic projects.

As .NET continues to thrive as with the C# language and overarching framework, I have iterated upon the initial hello world program that can be found in the src folder. Currently, it has been re-created using top-level statements and a minimal api to create a functioning REST API with three lines of source code.

Additionally, within the samples folder you can find a simple hello world program in each language I have at least briefly used.
